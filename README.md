python3 fuzzer.py https://<example.com?id= <path_to_file>

Make sure you put url with https otherwise it'll give you an error.
Path to file is a list for example with LFI payloads or XSS. The idea is to provide the response from the server to the requests with the payloads

I can't buy a Burp licence and enjoy intruder speed, so it's better to build something like this and at least the ram and processor will provide me the speed I need to process huge lists.
